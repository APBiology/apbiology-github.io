   <img class="colelem" id="u1000-65" alt="Chapter 1 1. Whose thoughts was Darwin affected by and how it led to natural selection The Recognition and Official Birth of Evolutionary Biology The very first time evolutionary biology was recognized as a discipline was in the 1930s, called the modern synthesis. This was when Mendelian genetics and Darwinian natural selection was combined through scientific means and officially great enough to be one of the central themes of biology. This moment is crucial in Biological disciplines because it is the merging of data (genes, fossils) and processes (natural selection) that allowed a proper theory to form. Like most scientists, he was affected by a lot of his predecessors who participated in their research. They all played a part in forming his thesis “descent with modification” and his On the Origin of Species. Also, the natural selection came with a co-founder, known as Alfred Russell Wallace, which allowed them to form the idea with strong backing. Now let us look at those scientists that heavily affected Darwin’s ideas in forming his theory. Creationists and Evolutionists: The Early Confusion Before the 19th century, people had different ideas and theories to account for the existence of such diversity among the different species and organisms. Often known as the creationists, they believed sincerely that organisms were all perfect and came from the creation of the God. Observing the fitness of the organisms in certain regions, people in the 17th century thought they were created by God for particular reasons. This view was later dominated by those of evolutionary scientists when multiple scientists, perhaps even influenced by modernist* views, brought a series of theories with proof by actual field work. Their contributions will not only change the explanation to why there is so much diversity, but also a major part of Biology that allowed insight into other fields. Carolus Linnaeus was one such biologist, physician and botanist. While making his Linnaean Taxon and the binomial naming system for organizing species, he based it on similarity of patterns rather than evolutionary relationships and common ancestors. This was criticized by Darwin as he strongly believed in common ancestry as the tree of life and how organisms should be categorized. Geology, Paleontology, and Time Three key people: Georges Cuvier (1769-1832), James Hutton (1726-1797), and Charles Lyell (1797-1875) were influential in terms of geological, paleontological, and chronical context. Georges Cuvier was a French pioneer paleontologist, and he observed multiple strata to discover that different strata represented different eras of life. In other words, natural disasters cause some species to go extinct. This can be observed by looking at a variety of strata and when the above layer is missing of a species entirely, it shows that it became extinct. http://digfieldschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/StrataColumnRayTroll.jpg However, for some reason, he opposed the idea of evolution. In 1795, James Hutton stated that Earth took a very long time to form, and formed through gradual mechanisms. Then Charles Lyell supported and supplemented that the geologic processes from the past continue today. These ideas were both groundbreaking, considering the fact that most scientists believed that Earth was not much older than a few thousand years old. Darwin applied these ideas to his theory, as he travels throughout the world, he would observe the geological impact on evolution. Thomas Malthus and his Economic beliefs You may ask, am I reading a credible source? Is this text just copied from another website? Of course not! Everything we mention here has a purpose, and Thomas Malthus is just one person we would like you to meet. Yes, he is an economist, but the ideas he stated does not only apply to us and the money we spend every day. In fact, if you haven’t yet, the society we live in is really just evolution – those who cannot earn enough money will eventually die, while the rich people will have better chances of survival and long age, and allow offsprings to grow in healthy conditions and get top-level education which builds up even more to the future. Now in this situation, Thomas Malthus stood up and said that resources are limited. Land, space, food is limited – and this particularly applied to Britain in the late 18th century to the 19th where populations were thriving. He also stated that more offsprings were born into the world, though not everyone gets to survive. This model will affect how Darwin sees the natural selection applied to organisms of different species. In a short sentence, resources are limited and that organisms must compete to survive – after the species have reached their carrying capacity. The above analogy may seem unlikely, but it occurs exactly the same way in nature too. The fitness of organism, as scientist always talk about, is measured not only by whether they survive or not, but the reproductive success – that the offsprings survive. Another vocabulary to know well is adaptation, which means the genetic variation that is favored by selection in a particular environment. Lamarck, the pioneer visionary of Evolution Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829), is often recognized as the scientist that incorrectly labelled evolution. For standardized test like the AP Biology exam or the SAT II, this is a great tip – that when the question mentions about which idea was wrong or who proposed it. But for his honor, we would not like to criticize, but to complement for his bravery. After all, he was one of the first and true evolutionary biologists that questioned why and how life exists in such diversity. First, there were two great accomplishments by Lamarck: He related evolution to explain why fossils exist and why certain organisms seem to be at certain environments. Then let us discuss about his two mistakes: ‘use and disuse’, and ‘inheritance of acquired characteristics’. Use and disuse stated that organisms during their lifetime develop more in portions of the body that they do use. This within some point is logical – like if an athlete would have stronger body parts than that of another occupation. However, it is not extreme like that of a giraffe stretching its neck to gain access to higher trees and eventually having longer necks. The other is inheritance of acquired characteristics – meaning that whatever physical features that was of the parents will be inherited to the children. Though there is a tendency that two athletic parents will more likely result in a stronger son because perhaps they were more fit for a particular type of sport, if both parents were not originally athletes and forced their way up there, their son would just be a normal intermediate of the parents’ genetics, not their physical characteristics. Lastly, Lamarck made a comment that organisms were becoming more and more complex and perfect through evolution, but that is not true. Organisms are merely adapting to changes in the environment, and some species are just more fit to some environments than others.   Alfred Russel Wallace Alfred Russel Wallace was a 19th century scientist and a pioneer to the development of the idea of natural selection. His papers had inspired Darwin, and together, they strengthen the idea. Prior to Darwin's publication of The Origin of Species, he had written a paper, and both their idea were similar as their support for the same radical theory. Wallace dealt with a lot of fieldwork, allowing him to discover such observations, just like how Darwin had visited the Galapagos islands. However, Wallace also had a strong background for being a geographer. He was known to be very open to radical ideas, like that of evolution, but also to politics, religion, and other factors. We will discuss more about him during Darwin’s travels with the HMS Beagle.   " src="images/u1000-65.png?crc=4286038155" data-image-width="882"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
